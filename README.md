## Models

Eight models are implemented and evaluated as part of this project:

**KAN variants** (primary subject of study):
| Model | Key | Description |
|---|---|---|
| EfficientKAN | `efficient_kan` | B-spline-based KAN with learnable grid and spline order |
| FourierKAN | `fourier_kan` | KAN using Fourier basis functions |
| WaveletKAN | `wavelet_kan` | KAN using wavelet basis functions |
| FastKAN | `fast_kan` | KAN using radial basis functions on a learnable grid |

**ANN baselines** (for comparison):
| Model | Key | Description |
|---|---|---|
| MLP | `mlp` | Multi-layer perceptron with dropout |
| CNN | `cnn` | 1-D convolutional network with dropout |
| RNN | `rnn` | Recurrent neural network with dropout |
| LSTM | `lstm` | Long short-term memory network with dropout |

All models are registered in `src/models/__init__.py` and share the same training pipeline (`tune.py`, `train_best.py`).

## Setup
1) Install dependencies: python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
2) Place the [raw H5 file](https://data.dtu.dk/articles/dataset/Tennessee_Eastman_Reference_Data_for_Fault-Detection_and_Decision_Support_Systems/13385936) (Mode 1 only) at the path set by `data.raw_source` in `configs/config.yaml` (default: `data\raw\TEP_Mode1.h5`)
3) Edit `configs/config.yaml` (random seed, splits, windowing, tuning search space)


## Pipeline Overview
1) Load and label data from H5 (`src/preprocessing/tep_data_processor.py`)
    - Randomly selects `total_runs` runs per IDV and splits them into train/val/test per the `splits` block in `configs/config.yaml` (e.g. 30/10/10 for Experiment 1, 160/0/40 for Experiment 2)
    - Label data with header row from "Processdata_Labels" and "Additional_Meas_Labels"
    - Add target column for classifcation of timestep: healthy (0), IDV(X) (X)
        -Healthy data is indices 0-599
        -Faulty data is indices 600-2001
2) Perform pre-processing and feature engineering
    - Feature engineering
        -Drop features with zero variance
        -Drop features corresponding with analyzer measurements (Not realistic to have in real-life application of model)
    - Scaling (Z-scale)
        -Perform scaling on training dataset with transformation applied to validation and testing dataset
3) Generate sliding windows
    -Create sliding windows per the `windowing` block in `configs/config.yaml` (default: length 5, stride 1)
4) Train model (`scripts/train_best.py`)
    - Trains a model variant using hyperparameters already found in tuning (`best_params.json`), with no Optuna and no val split (early stops on train loss)
    - Saves model weights, training loss curve, and `predictions.npz` (probabilities + metadata) for the variant
5) Hyperparameter tuning (`scripts/tune.py`)
    - Runs an Optuna search (TPE sampler) per model variant, scoring each trial on the validation split, to find the best hyperparameters
    - Retrains the best trial's configuration and saves `best_params.json` alongside weights and `predictions.npz`
6) Evaluate performance (`scripts/evaluate.py`)
    - Loads each variant's saved `predictions.npz` (no retraining) and computes accuracy, F1, alarm metrics (FAR/CNR/FDR/MR), and fault detection/diagnosis timing
    - Outputs a combined `model_evaluation.xlsx` comparing all variants

---

## Experiment 1 — Hyperparameter Tuning

Uses 50 runs per IDV (30 train / 10 val / 10 test) to find the best hyperparameters
for each model via Optuna (50 trials per model).

**Config settings** (`configs/config.yaml`):
```yaml
data:
  processed_base_dir: 'data\processed'   # suffix auto-appended → data\processed_N50_tr30_v10_te10
splits:
  total_runs: 50
  train_runs: 30
  val_runs: 10
  test_runs: 10
models:
  results_base_dir: 'results'            # suffix auto-appended → results_N50_tr30_v10_te10
```

The output and results directories are **automatically derived** from the split settings — no manual path changes needed between experiments.

**Run order:**

```bash
# 1. Extract and preprocess data (50 runs/IDV, 30/10/10 split)
python scripts/run_pipeline.py
```
Outputs to `data/processed_N50_tr30_v10_te10/`:

- `scaler.pkl` — fitted StandardScaler (fit on train only)
- `train_final.pkl` — scaled training DataFrame
- `val_final.pkl` — scaled validation DataFrame
- `test_final.pkl` — scaled test DataFrame
- `train_final_sample.csv` — first 10,000 rows of train for inspection

```bash
# 2. Create sliding windows (train, val, test)
python scripts/create_windows.py
```
Outputs to `data/processed_N50_tr30_v10_te10/windows/`:
- `train_windows_w5_s1.npz` — training windows (X, y, metadata)
- `val_windows_w5_s1.npz` — validation windows
- `test_windows_w5_s1.npz` — test windows

```bash
# 3. Tune all models (Optuna, 50 trials each)

# ANN baselines
python scripts/tune.py --model mlp
python scripts/tune.py --model cnn

```
Outputs per model to `results_N50_tr30_v10_te10/<model>/`:
- `best_params.json` — best hyperparameters found by Optuna
- `best_model.pt` — model retrained with best hyperparameters
- `predictions.npz` — test set predictions (`y_pred`, `y_true`, `y_prob`, `Run_ID`, `start_idx`, `end_idx`)
- `metrics.json` — val accuracy, training loss curve, trial count, best trial number

```bash
# 4. Evaluate results
python scripts/evaluate.py
```
Outputs per model to `results_N50_tr30_v10_te10/<model>/`:
- `eval_metrics.json` — full metrics (see Evaluation Outputs below)

python scripts/plot_time_series.py
```
Outputs per model to `results_N50_tr30_v10_te10/<model>/`:
- `time_series_IDV{k}.png` — probability time-series plot for each fault class

---

## Experiment 2 — Full Dataset Training (200 runs/IDV)

Trains all eight models on the full dataset (200 runs per IDV, 160 train / 40 test)
using the best hyperparameters found in Experiment 1. No hyperparameter search is
performed — `best_params.json` from `results/` is loaded directly.

**Prerequisite:** Experiment 1 must be completed. The following files must exist for each model:
```
results_N50_tr30_v10_te10/<model>/best_params.json
```
where `<model>` is each of: `efficient_kan`, `fourier_kan`, `wavelet_kan`, `fast_kan`, `mlp`, `cnn`, `rnn`, `lstm`.

**Config settings** (`configs/config.yaml`):
```yaml
data:
  processed_base_dir: 'data\processed'   # suffix auto-appended → data\processed_N200_tr160_v0_te40
splits:
  total_runs: 200
  train_runs: 160
  val_runs: 0
  test_runs: 40
models:
  results_base_dir: 'results'            # suffix auto-appended → results_N200_tr160_v0_te40
```

The output and results directories are **automatically derived** from the split settings — only the `splits` block needs to change between experiments.

**Run order:**

```bash
# 1. Extract and preprocess data (200 runs/IDV, 160/40 split, no validation)
python scripts/run_pipeline.py
```
Outputs to `data/processed_N200_tr160_v0_te40/`:
- `feature_engineer.pkl` — fitted feature engineering pipeline
- `scaler.pkl` — fitted StandardScaler (fit on train only)
- `train_final.pkl` — scaled training DataFrame (160 runs/IDV)
- `test_final.pkl` — scaled test DataFrame (40 runs/IDV)
- `train_final_sample.csv` — first 10,000 rows of train for inspection

```bash
# 2. Create sliding windows (train and test only — no val)
python scripts/create_windows.py
```
Outputs to `data/processed_N200_tr160_v0_te40/windows/`:
- `train_windows_w5_s1.npz` — training windows (X, y, metadata)
- `test_windows_w5_s1.npz` — test windows

```bash
# 3. Train all models with tuned hyperparameters (early stopping on train loss)
#    --params-dir points to best_params.json files from Experiment 1
python scripts/train_best.py --all --params-dir results_N50_tr30_v10_te10
```
This trains all 8 models (4 KAN variants + 4 ANN baselines) sequentially.
To train a single model instead:
```bash
python scripts/train_best.py --model wavelet_kan --params-dir results_N50_tr30_v10_te10
python scripts/train_best.py --model lstm        --params-dir results_N50_tr30_v10_te10
```
Outputs per model to `results_N200_tr160_v0_te40/<model>/`:
- `best_model.pt` — final trained model weights
- `predictions.npz` — test set predictions (`y_pred`, `y_true`, `y_prob`, `Run_ID`, `start_idx`, `end_idx`)
- `metrics.json` — test accuracy, epoch count, training loss curve

```bash
# 4. Evaluate results
python scripts/evaluate.py
```
Outputs per model to `results_N200_tr160_v0_te40/<model>/`:
- `eval_metrics.json` — full metrics (see Evaluation Outputs below)
- `loss_curve.png` — training loss curve
- `confusion_matrix.png` — row-normalised confusion matrix heatmap

Output to `results_N200_tr160_v0_te40/`:
- `model_evaluation.xlsx` — cross-model comparison workbook (see Evaluation Outputs below)

```bash
# 5. (Optional) Generate per-fault probability time-series plots
python scripts/plot_time_series.py
```
Outputs per model to `results_N200_tr160_v0_te40/<model>/`:
- `time_series_IDV{k}.png` — probability time-series plot for each fault class

---

## Evaluation Outputs

`eval_metrics.json` contains the following fields for each model:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `accuracy` | Overall test accuracy |
| `macro_f1` | Macro-averaged F1 score |
| `per_class_f1` | F1 score for each class |
| `confusion_matrix` | Raw confusion matrix |
| `classes` | Ordered list of class integers present in the test set |
| `mean_conf_correct` | Mean softmax confidence on correctly predicted windows |
| `mean_conf_wrong` | Mean softmax confidence on incorrectly predicted windows |
| `alarm_threshold` | Fault-probability threshold used for alarm metrics (0.90) |
| `false_alarm_rate` | FAR — proportion of healthy windows that trigger alarm |
| `correct_normal_rate` | CNR — proportion of healthy windows correctly not alarmed (= 1 − FAR) |
| `detection_rate` | FDR — proportion of fault windows that trigger alarm (all fault classes) |
| `miss_rate` | MR — proportion of fault windows that do not trigger alarm (= 1 − FDR) |
| `per_class_detection_rate` | FDR broken down by individual fault class IDV# |
| `mean_top2_margin` | Mean gap between top-1 and top-2 softmax probabilities |
| `frac_ambiguous` | Fraction of windows where top-2 margin < 10 pp |
| `timing_metrics` | Per-fault-class FDet/FDiag timing (see below) |
| `best_params` | Hyperparameters used for this run (from `best_params.json`, if present) |
| `val_accuracy`, `n_trials`, `best_trial` | Optuna tuning metadata (Experiment 1 only; `null` for Experiment 2) |
| `epochs_trained`, `training_time_s` | Epochs run before early stopping and wall-clock training time |

**Alarm metric definitions** (threshold: fault probability = 1 − P(class 0) > 0.90 by default — see Sensitivity Analysis below for varying this):

```
FAR + CNR = 1.0   (all healthy windows accounted for)
FDR + MR  = 1.0   (all fault windows accounted for)
```

`timing_metrics` (per fault class IDV#, relative to fault insertion at index 600):
- `fdet_mean` / `fdet_std` — Fault Detection Time: first window where P(NOC) drops below the alarm threshold
- `fdiag_mean` / `fdiag_std` — Fault Diagnosis Time: first window where the probability of the *true* fault class exceeds 90%
- `fdiag_accuracy` — **conditional** accuracy: of all windows confidently diagnosed (any non-NOC class > 90%), the fraction diagnosed as the correct class
- `coverage` — of *all* post-fault windows for this class, the fraction that ever reach that 90% confidence bar at all (regardless of which class). `fdiag_accuracy` says nothing about how often the model is confident in the first place — a class can show high `fdiag_accuracy` while rarely being confident at all, which `coverage` exposes. Low coverage + high `fdiag_accuracy` reads as "rarely confident, but reliable when it is" (e.g. IDV28: ~22% coverage, ~99.8% conditional accuracy, despite a much lower raw recall in the confusion matrix); low coverage + low `fdiag_accuracy` reads as "rarely confident, and usually wrong when it is" (e.g. IDV15).

`model_evaluation.xlsx` (written by `evaluate.py`, one row/column per model) contains:
- **Model Comparison** — accuracy, macro F1, val accuracy, confidence, epochs, training time, best params
- **Per-Class F1** — F1 score per fault class, per model
- **Alarm Analysis** — FAR, CNR, FDR, MR, top-2 margin, per model
- **Per-Class Detection Rate** — detection rate per fault class, per model
- **Fault Detection Time** — FDet mean ± std and detected/total count per fault class, per model
- **Fault Diagnosis Time** — FDiag mean ± std, conditional diagnosis accuracy, and coverage (% of windows ever confidently diagnosed) per fault class, per model

## Sensitivity Analysis

Sensitivity sweeps re-examine an **already-trained** model under different post-hoc or pipeline settings, isolating one variable at a time. Each sweep is documented in its own subsection below as it's implemented.

### Alarm-Threshold Sweep

Varies the alarm-onset cutoff — the model and its weights are untouched; this only changes how the *already-computed* softmax probabilities (`predictions.npz` → `y_prob`) are thresholded to decide "alarm vs. no alarm." No retraining or data regeneration is involved, since the threshold never enters the training objective.

By default, an alarm fires when `P(NOC) < 10%` (`alarm_threshold = 0.90` in `evaluate.py`). This sweep recomputes alarm/timing metrics at `P(NOC) < 5%, 7.5%, 10%, 12.5%, 15%` against the same saved predictions.

**Prerequisite:** `predictions.npz` must already exist for the target model(s) (i.e. `train_best.py` or `tune.py` has been run for them). Models missing `predictions.npz` are skipped with a warning.

```bash
# Sweep the default thresholds (5%, 7.5%, 10%, 12.5%, 15%) for the default models (WavKAN, MLP, CNN)
python scripts/sensitivity_threshold.py

# Or specify a single model, a custom subset, and/or custom thresholds
python scripts/sensitivity_threshold.py --model wavelet_kan
python scripts/sensitivity_threshold.py --model wavelet_kan,mlp,cnn --thresholds 0.05,0.10,0.20
```

Output to `<results_dir>/<model>/threshold_sensitivity.xlsx` for each model swept (e.g. `results_N200_tr160_v0_te40/wavelet_kan/threshold_sensitivity.xlsx`), one column per threshold instead of per model:
- **Alarm Analysis** — FAR, CNR, FDR, MR per threshold
- **Per-Class Detection Rate** — detection rate per fault class, per threshold
- **Fault Detection Time** — FDet mean ± std and detected/total count per fault class, per threshold
- **Fault Diagnosis Time** — FDiag mean ± std, diagnosed/total count, conditional diagnosis accuracy, and coverage per fault class, per threshold (using `diagnosis_confidence = 1 - threshold`)

### Window-Size Sweep

Varies `window_size ∈ {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}` (stride fixed at 1) for WavKAN. Unlike the threshold sweep, this **does** require retraining — window size changes the model's input dimension (`window_size × n_features`, flattened), so weights from one window size are architecturally incompatible with another. It does **not** require re-running `run_pipeline.py`, though: feature engineering and scaling operate on raw per-timestep rows and never touch window size — only `create_windows.py` does, and it writes window files as `{split}_windows_w{N}_s{stride}.npz`, so every window size can live in the same `windows/` folder without collision.

Hyperparameters are **not** re-tuned per window size, the same file Experiment 2 already loads from are reused unchanged for every window size — no Optuna re-run. This isolates the effect of window size from confounding hyperparameter-search variance.

**Config:** one YAML per window size — `configs/sensitivity_window_1.yaml`, `_3.yaml`, `_7.yaml`, `_9.yaml` (window 5 reuses the existing baseline `configs/config.yaml`). Each only differs from `configs/config.yaml` in `windowing.window_size` and `models.results_base_dir` (`results_w1`, `results_w3`, etc. — must differ per window size since `results_dir`/`output_dir` are otherwise derived only from `splits`, not windowing). `data.processed_base_dir` and `splits` are left unchanged so all window sizes share the same extracted/scaled data.

**Run order per window size** (skip 5 — already trained as the Exp 2 baseline):
```bash
python scripts/create_windows.py --config configs/sensitivity_window_1.yaml
python scripts/train_best.py --model wavelet_kan --config configs/sensitivity_window_1.yaml --params-dir results_N50_tr30_v10_te10
python scripts/evaluate.py --model wavelet_kan --config configs/sensitivity_window_1.yaml
```
(repeat for `_3`, `_7`, `_9`)

**Once all five window sizes have `eval_metrics.json`, aggregate them:**
```bash
python scripts/sensitivity_window.py --model wavelet_kan
```
No recomputation needed here — each `eval_metrics.json` already has everything, so this just loads and re-keys by window-size label. Output to `window_sensitivity_<model>.xlsx` in the repo root (spans multiple experiment folders, so it doesn't belong inside any one of them), with the same six sheets as `model_evaluation.xlsx` but one column per window size (`w1`, `w3`, `w5`, `w7`, `w9`) instead of per model.

### Quantity-of-Data Sweep

Varies the total number of runs per IDV across `{15, 25, 50, 100, 150, 200}`, with the 80:20 train/test split held fixed (no validation split, no re-tuning). Like the window-size sweep, this **does** require retraining — a different number of training runs changes what the model sees and therefore its weights. Unlike the threshold sweep, it also requires re-running `run_pipeline.py` and `create_windows.py` for each new run count, since the data splits must be regenerated.

Hyperparameters are **not** re-tuned per run count; the same `best_params.json` from Experiment 1 (`results_N50_tr30_v10_te10`) is reused for all six points. This isolates the effect of data quantity from confounding hyperparameter-search variance.

The N=200 point is identical to Experiment 2 (`results_N200_tr160_v0_te40`) and reuses those already-computed results — no extra training needed.

**Data points and auto-derived directories:**

| N   | Train | Val | Test | Config                              | Processed data dir                  | Results dir                   |

| 200 | 160   | 0   | 40   | `configs/config.yaml` *(Exp 2)*     | `data/processed_N200_tr160_v0_te40`| `results_N200_tr160_v0_te40` ✓|

**Run order per N** (repeat for N = 15, 25, 50, 100, 150; skip 200 — already done as Experiment 2):

```bash
# Replace {N} with 15, 25, 50, 100, or 150
python scripts/run_pipeline.py    --config configs/sensitivity_quantity_{N}.yaml
python scripts/create_windows.py  --config configs/sensitivity_quantity_{N}.yaml
python scripts/train_best.py --model wavelet_kan --config configs/sensitivity_quantity_{N}.yaml --params-dir results_N50_tr30_v10_te10
python scripts/evaluate.py   --model wavelet_kan --config configs/sensitivity_quantity_{N}.yaml
```

**Once all six run counts have `eval_metrics.json`, aggregate them:**
```bash
python scripts/sensitivity_quantity.py --model wavelet_kan
```
No recomputation needed here — each `eval_metrics.json` already has everything, so this just loads and re-keys by run-count label. Output to `quantity_sensitivity_<model>.xlsx` in the repo root (spans multiple experiment folders, so it doesn't belong inside any one of them), with the same six sheets as `model_evaluation.xlsx` but one column per run count (`N15`, `N25`, `N50`, `N100`, `N150`, `N200`) instead of per model.
